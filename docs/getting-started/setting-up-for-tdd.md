## Setting up for TDD

### vue-cli

`vue-test-utils` is the official testing library for Vue, and will be used throughout the guide. It runs in both a browser and Node.js environment, and works with any test runner. 

`vue-cli` is the easiest way to get started. It will set up a project, as well as configure Jest, a popular testing framework. Install it by running:

```sh
yarn global add @vue/cli
```

or with npm:

```sh
npm install -g @vue/cli
```
